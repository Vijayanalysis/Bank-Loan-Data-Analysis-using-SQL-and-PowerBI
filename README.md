# Bank-Loan-Data-Analysis-using-SQL-and-PowerBI

This repository contains the code and documentation for the Customized Bank Loan Report project. Below you'll find the domain knowledge in domain_knowledge.md, problem statement in problem_statement.md and an overview of the solution implemented using SQL and Power BI.

# || PROJECT SUMMARY ||

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of bank loan data using Microsoft SQL Server and Power BI. The project involved several steps, including database creation, data importation, and connection to Power BI for analysis.

# Key Highlights:
Created a database in Microsoft SQL Server and imported bank loan data.
Connected SQL Server to Power BI to perform data analysis.
Developed three dashboards to address specific problem statements:
A- Summary Dashboard: Monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total loan applications, funded amount, amount received, average interest rate, and debt-to-income ratio.
B- Overview Dashboard: Utilizing charts to analyze monthly trends, regional disparities, loan term distribution, employment length impact, loan purpose breakdown, and home ownership analysis.
C- Details Dashboard: A comprehensive view of essential loan-related metrics and data points, facilitating efficient access to critical information.
Final Step
Conducted testing of all values obtained in the Power BI report by writing logical SQL queries in Microsoft SQL Server. This ensured accurate cross-checking of values between Power BI and SQL Server, enhancing data integrity.
